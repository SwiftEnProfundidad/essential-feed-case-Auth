**Cobertura global:** 771 / 873 l√≠neas (**88.3%**)

## ‚úÖ Strengths
- Seguridad (Keychain, SecureStorage, Registro, Login): cobertura muy alta, tests unitarios e integraci√≥n.
- Cobertura de escenarios reales y edge cases principales.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Areas to Improve
- `SystemKeychain.swift`: mejorar cobertura en ramas as√≠ncronas y errores raros.
- Factories/helpers auxiliares: cubrir edge cases extremos.

## üîé Recomendaciones profesionales
- Mantener cobertura >85% como est√°ndar m√≠nimo.
- Priorizar tests en helpers y callbacks as√≠ncronos para llegar al 100% en seguridad.
- Documentar expl√≠citamente los tests de edge cases para facilitar auditor√≠a.
